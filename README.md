A heatmap was generated to visualize the distribution of null values, revealing that the 'Director', 'Cast', and 'Country' fields had the highest incidence of missing data.

## Questions Addressed
The analysis aimed to answer several pertinent questions about Netflix's content distribution and characteristics:
- **Highest Number Of Shows Released Per Year**: A graph was created to visualize the trend of content release over the years.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The initial phase of the project involved data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the integrity of the analysis. This process included:
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Handling null values strategically.
- Identifying fields with the most missing data to inform potential data collection improvements.

## Visualizations
The repository includes a series of visualizations that were instrumental in uncovering insights from the Netflix dataset. These visualizations are crucial for understanding the dynamics of content distribution on the platform.
We came to following analysis from the above exploratory data analysis that we did:-
- With Each Year There has been increased in number of number of shows released
- There is more movies released compared to TV Shows 
- We were able to find the list of movies released in India
- We also were able to deduce that maximum TV Show released every year is increasing with United State being the top followed by United Kindom South Korea and Japan.
- We were able to deduce the TOP Ten Director in TV Shows 
- We were able to deduce diffrent Types of Rating Given For a show.
- We deduced that the maximum duration of TV Show is released in United States.
